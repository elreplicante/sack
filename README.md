# sack

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elreplicante/sack.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elreplicante/sack)

Control information before information controls you!.  Sack is a simple search engine focused in your interests.  Simply add an item to the sack and search over your stuff.

This project is in a beta stage.  The main idea is to build a search engine that is not indexed by dark algorithms and commercial purposes.  Let's keep the web semantic!

##Requirements
1. Ruby 2.0.0
2. Rails 4.0.0
3. Mongodb >= 2.1


##Installation
1. Git clone the repo
2. <code>cd</code> into the sack folder and execute <code>bundle install</code>
3. <code>rails s</code> and start adding items to the sack!
